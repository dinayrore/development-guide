#### Activity -- Highlight Data Formats
Providing a user advanced notice of what they are required to complete on a form reduces user error and increases a positive user experience. The common convention for marking a form field as required is to utilize the `span` tag and CSS to create a red asterisk. However, for users with visual impairments using this format is not ideal. Providing progammtic text descriptions to a label will allow a screen reader to announce the information that required. 

##### Instructions
Alter the `index.html` file provided in the root level public directory to complete the following:

1.	Add a constraint to one or more of the form fields

> **HINT:** max and min character limits are constraints

2. Mark required form controls as required and optional form controls as optional
