## Web Accessibility

### Introduction 

Accessibility is inclusion. Providing equal access and equal opportunities for all people to interact with digital information opens up the possibilities for users with disabilities to participate more actively with their surroundings and within our society. The [ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)](https://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/services/ada-compliance), [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [international standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) define the requirements for accessibility compliance.
