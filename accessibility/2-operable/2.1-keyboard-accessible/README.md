### [Guideline 2.1 â€“ Keyboard Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#keyboard-accessible)
Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

#### [Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard - (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#keyboard)
All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

> *Note 1:* This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.

> *Note 2:* This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
