### [Guideline  1.1 Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#text-alternatives)
Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

#### [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#non-text-content)
All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

##### Controls, Input
If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

##### Time-Based Media
If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)

##### Test
If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

##### Sensory
If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

##### CAPTCHA
If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

##### Decoration, Formatting, Invisible
If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
