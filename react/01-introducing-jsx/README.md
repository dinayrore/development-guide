## [Introducing JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

> *JSX? I thought we were learning everything using TS?* 

Well, you are not wrong, but first we need to talk about the syntax extension that TSX compiles to... JSX.

### Getting Started
1. A static server can be used to view React components with JS.
    - Install the recommended plugins for VS Code. 
    - OR use an alternate method to start a static server (python, ruby, etc).
2. In the comment `{/* add HTML here */}` add your own hypertext markup to be rendered on the page

#### Example Code
```html
<h1>Hello World! ðŸŒŽ</h1>
```

### What's Next
You've done it! You've rendered your first React components using JSX! ðŸŽ‰ 

There is one more lesson visualizing the structure of a React Application using components and JS. Then we will be working with TS and the React library itself.
